[Google Cloud Marketplace](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools)

Please note that while HELM installations allow the use of RBAC and Service Accounts, the Google Marketplace Installation does not, hence there are two pathways to a successful SYNTASA install.

To install using HELM, please see: [`HELM_INSTALLATION`](/docs/HELM_INSTALLATION.md)

To install using MPDEV, please see: [`MPDEV_INSTALLATION`](/docs/MPDEV_INSTALLATION.md)
